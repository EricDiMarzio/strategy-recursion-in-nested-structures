# Recursion Strategy Lecture

The purpose of this strategy lecture is to help residents identify use cases for recursion in algorithm prompts. The common thread is to understand the power of Depth First Search (DFS) logic and how it relates to the call stack (and stacks in general). This is the fundamental logic behind recursion in JavaScript, which calculates the deepest function call first before returning up through each execution context.

From there, we employ conditional logic to either perform recursion or return a calculated value based on an element's primitive data type. This allows us to find simple solutions to common technical interview questions like Two Sum, Rock Paper Scissors, and Number of Islands.

## Order of Presentation

1. **Flatten Deep**
2. **BST Height**
3. **Linked List Length**
4. **Sum Nested Array**

## Note

Since this is a strategy lecture and not a challenge repository, all test suites point to the solution files.
